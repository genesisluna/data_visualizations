# Paying Attention to America's Safety
This project is focused on the exploratory analysis of current health-related issues in America

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze current health and safety issues facing Americans today such as the opioid epidemic, mass shootings, and veteran suicides. Using visualizations and data exploration on these topics can reveal insight in to these epdemics.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Seaborn, numpy, matplotlib

## Project Description
Americans are often left with many questions after traumatic events. 
* The opioid epidemic is becoming an increasing problem. Are the prescribing rates for opioid medication too high in America? Are there correlations between the regions in America with the highest prescribing rates?
* Exploring data for mass shootings could reveal correlations between different attributes of the shooters. Were mental health issues or race a factor in these shootings? Has there been a drastic increase in violence over time?
* Many veterans struggle everyday to integrate back in to society. Are there correlations between veteran genders and their suicide rates? What about the states they reside in?

This project aims to explore any correlations we may find between these issues and their coinciding factors.
